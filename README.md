# epp_tools
A collection of tools for interacting with ePropertiesPlus by STR Software.
epp_mowing_service_handler.py is a tool to take an export of services, match it
to an invoice, match the appropriate pictures and then create an archive with
the spreadsheet and images ready to be imported back into ePropertyPlus.

This is not likely to be terribly useful for anyone except Renew Indianapolis,
the City of Indianapolis and Allied Land Services.
